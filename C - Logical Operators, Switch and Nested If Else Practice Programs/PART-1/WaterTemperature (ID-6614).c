/* The program must accept a character CH indicating the temperature of the water available in a tap as the input.

- If CH is L, then the tap is for Hot water.
- If CH is R, then the tap is for Cold water.
- If CH is M, then the tap is for Moderate water.

The program must print the corresponding type of water for the tap as the output. If CH is not L or R or M, the program must print TURN ON as the output.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
L

Output:
Hot water

Example Input/ Output 2:
Input:
S

Output:
TURN ON  */
